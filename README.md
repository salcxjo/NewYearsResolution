This is a simple Python app (using Python 3.12.3) that keeps track of new year's resolutions. I made this so I can keep check on my ambitious new year's resolutions. Works best for quantifiable goals like running and pushups. This is my first time using JSON libraries to store data.
Some of the features: Adding goals (Name, Amount, Unit), Editing Goals, Adding Progress, Getting a report, getting a report of what's remaining and Saving before exiting.
This is a WIP especially when it comes to JSON methods.
